# Advent of Code 2018

My solutions to Advent of Code 2018. I'm including a lot of comments this year in order to help a friend who is learning Python.

## Structure

I'll place each day in its own folder, so the first day will be in `/day01`, the second day will be in `day02`, etc. Within the folder for each day, I'll typically separate the solutions for parts 1 and 2 into two separate files: `part1.py` and `part2.py`. Puzzle inputs, where applicable, will be located in the `/inputs` directory within the day folder.

In some instances, where I know I've really hacked together a sub-optimal solution, I'll go back and try to build an optimized solution instead. In these instances, I'll add `-optimized` to the original file name.
